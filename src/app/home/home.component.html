    Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only object in the Universe known to harbor life. According to radiometric
    dating and other sources of evidence, Earth formed over 4.5 billion years ago.Earth's gravity interacts
    with other objects in space, especially the Sun and the Moon, Earth's only natural satellite. Earth revolves around the
    Sun in 365.26 days, a period known as an Earth year. During this time, Earth rotates about its axis about 366.26 times.
  Earth's axis of rotation is tilted with respect to its orbital plane, producing seasons on Earth.The gravitational
    interaction between Earth and the Moon causes ocean tides, stabilizes Earth's orientation on its axis, and gradually
    slows its rotation.Earth is the densest planet in the Solar System and the largest of the four terrestrial planets.
    Earth's lithosphere is divided into several rigid tectonic plates that migrate across the surface over periods of many
    millions of years. About 71% of Earth's surface is covered with water, mostly by oceans.The remaining 29% is land
    consisting of continents and islands that together have many lakes, rivers and other sources of water that contribute
    to the hydrosphere. The majority of Earth's polar regions are covered in ice, including the Antarctic ice sheet and the
    sea ice of the Arctic ice pack. Earth's interior remains active with a solid iron inner core, a liquid outer core that
    generates the Earth's magnetic field, and a convecting mantle that drives plate tectonics. Within the first billion years
    of Earth's history, life appeared in the oceans and began to affect the Earth's atmosphere and surface, leading to the
    proliferation of aerobic and anaerobic organisms. Some geological evidence indicates that life may have arisen as much
    as 4.1 billion years ago. Since then, the combination of Earth's distance from the Sun, physical properties, and geological
    history have allowed life to evolve and thrive.In the history of the Earth, biodiversity has gone through long
    periods of expansion, occasionally punctuated by mass extinction events. Over 99% of all species that ever lived
    on Earth are extinct.Estimates of the number of species on Earth today vary widely;most species
    have not been described.Over 7.6 billion humans live on Earth and depend on its biosphere and natural resources
    for their survival. Humans have developed diverse societies and cultures; politically, the world has about 200 sovereign
    states.
